# My Little Lemon Restaurant - React Capstone Project

This project is part of the Meta Front-End Developer course. It includes a homepage, an about page, and a reservation page. The main goal was to create a booking form so that clients can make reservations. The UI is based on a prototype previously created in Figma. The project demonstrates skills in front-end development using React, focusing on creating a responsive and accessible user interface.

## Features

- **Homepage**: A welcoming page with an introduction to the restaurant. It contains a hero section, week's specials, testimonials. 
- **About Page**: Information about the restaurant's history, mission, and team.
- **Reservation Page**: A booking form allowing clients to make reservations easily. Emphasis was given on the form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly.
- **Menu, Order Online & Login**: They appear only the navigation bar as required by the assignment.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: All sections were created with react components.
- **React Router DOM**: Library for routing in React applications.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **CSS**: Responsive design optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
- **Figma**: For the initial UI design, wireframing and prototyping using the UI-kit provided in the course.
- **API**: Since the APIs provided by the course did not work, I have simulated the behaviour in a different way (fetchAPI, submitAPI in App.js component)
